# Continue Log â€“ main + meta-process-complete

## HANDOFF-2025-09-21-[CURRENT]
### Session Duration: 2 hours
### Branch: main
### Completed:
- Implemented `learn` command for hub dependency acquisition
  - Single package learning: `./bin/repos.py learn <package>`
  - Batch learning: `./bin/repos.py learn all`
  - Smart domain categorization (text, data, time, web, system, dev, random)
  - Manual TOML editing fallback when toml library unavailable
  - Successfully learned 4 packages: unicode-width, criterion, thiserror, tempfile
- Implemented `notes` command for hub metadata management
  - View metadata: `./bin/repos.py notes <repo>`
  - Create metadata: `./bin/repos.py notes <repo> --create`
  - Added [package.metadata.hub] section to boxy repository
- Updated serde to version 1.0.226
- Hub now has 16 current packages (increased from 12)
- Committed changes: b162a9f

### Current Status:
- Hub package count: 16 current, 0 outdated, 1 gap (rsb - intentionally excluded)
- TSV cache regenerated with new packages
- Both commands fully integrated with existing cache system
- Ready for Meteor integration phase

### Blockers:
- None identified

### Next Agent MUST:
1. Read START.txt for orientation
2. Review this CONTINUE.md for current state
3. Check `./bin/repos.py hub` for current package status
4. Begin Meteor integration:
   - Update Meteor's Cargo.toml to use hub
   - Replace direct dependencies with hub imports
   - Test functionality preservation

### Context Preservation:
- `learn` command intelligently skips already-learned packages via hub_status check
- `learn all` excludes RSB to prevent circular dependencies
- `notes --create` adds well-formatted metadata section with comments
- Hub metadata enables per-repo configuration (hub_sync, priority, notes)
- Package categorization uses keyword matching for domain assignment
- Manual TOML editing implemented as fallback (write_cargo_toml_manually, add_hub_metadata_section)

### Files Modified:
- bin/repos.py - Added learn_package(), learn_all_opportunities(), view_repo_notes(), add_hub_metadata_section()
- Cargo.toml - Added unicode-width, criterion, thiserror, tempfile
- Cargo.lock - Updated with new dependencies
- /home/xnull/repos/code/rust/oodx/projects/boxy/Cargo.toml - Added hub metadata section

## HANDOFF-2025-09-20-1600
### Session Duration: 2 hours
### Branch: main
### Completed:
- META_PROCESS v2 implementation validation and completion
- Extracted golden wisdom from .eggs/ and .session/ to docs/ref/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Created docs/procs/ACHIEVEMENTS.md celebrating strategic successes
- Cleaned up temporary analysis files (.eggs, .session) to docs/misc/archive/
- Updated START.txt to reflect Meta Process v2 structure
- Verified project exceeds Meta Process v2 requirements

### Blocked:
- None - all checklist items completed

### Next Agent MUST:
- Review docs/procs/ACHIEVEMENTS.md for strategic context
- Use docs/ref/ARCHITECTURE.md for technical architecture reference
- Follow START.txt workflow for 5-minute productive starts

### Context Hash: (to be updated on next commit)
### Files Modified: 4 (ARCHITECTURE.md, ACHIEVEMENTS.md, START.txt, CONTINUE.md)

## Configuration Notes
Hub project serves as Meta Process v2 EXEMPLAR with:
- 100x+ performance improvements validated
- HORUS Level 2 UAT certification achieved
- Comprehensive documentation system with validation automation
- Self-hydrating workflow enabling 5-minute agent starts

## Hub Status
**Production Ready**: Centralized dependency management system complete
**Performance**: 100x+ improvements across all major analysis functions
**Quality**: HORUS Level 2 certified with minimal technical debt
**Architecture**: TSV cache system with hub-aware ecosystem tracking
**Documentation**: Meta Process v2 exemplar standard achieved

**Ready for ecosystem integration starting with Meteor project**
