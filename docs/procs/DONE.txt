STRATEGY DOCUMENTATION UPDATE PLAN
===================================

CORRECTION: The strategy documents should NOT be removed - they are key architectural documents that need updating! China's analysis shows these are valuable assets documenting successful strategy implementation.

STRATEGY DOCUMENTS TO UPDATE (High Priority):

1. docs/VERSION_STRAT.md (STATUS: 85% current)
   - Update tool references: ./bin/deps.py → ./bin/repos.py → blade
   - Add integration with current blade commands (conflicts, review, hub, pkg)
   - Update semv integration examples

2. docs/REFACTOR_STRAT.md (STATUS: 95% implemented - SUCCESS STORY!)
   - Mark phases as COMPLETED - this is a victory!
   - Document 100x+ performance achievement via TSV cache
   - Update tool references and add new features (boxy integration)
   - Celebrate successful implementation

3. docs/HUB_STRAT.md (STATUS: 60% relevant)
   - Update "Cargohold" → "Hub" naming throughout
   - Document current implementation status
   - Preserve excellent TSV documentation (lines 259-578)
   - Update command examples to current syntax

FILES FOR REMOVAL:

1. .session/CONTINUE.md
   - Temporary session file, safe to remove

Note: These strategy documents show successful planning → implementation and should be updated to reflect achievements, not removed.
