 🚀 HUB - START HERE
================================================================================

👋 **Welcome to Hub Development!**

Hub is the **centralized dependency management system** for the entire oodx/RSB
ecosystem. It eliminates version conflicts, dependency bloat, and upgrade hell
by providing a single source of truth for external dependencies.

📋 **Single Entry Point**: Read docs/procs/PROCESS.txt for complete workflow

🎯 **Quick Start** (5 minutes to productive work):
1. Read docs/procs/PROCESS.txt ← Master workflow guide (3 min read)
2. Read docs/procs/ACHIEVEMENTS.md ← Strategic successes (1 min read)
3. Run blade hub ← Ecosystem status (1 min read)
4. Begin work with full context

⚡ **Ultra-Fast Start** (30 seconds):
→ Read docs/procs/QUICK_REF.txt for essential context only

🔍 **System Health Check**:
→ Run ./bin/validate-docs.sh to verify documentation integrity

📁 **All Process Documents Located in docs/procs/**
📊 **Reference Documentation in docs/ref/**
📈 **Strategic Documentation**:
- docs/HUB_STRAT.md - Core architecture strategy
- docs/REFACTOR_STRAT.md - Data cache implementation (COMPLETE)
- docs/VERSION_STRAT.md - Semantic versioning strategy

🔧 **Essential Tools**:
- blade - Production dependency analysis (100x+ performance)
- docs/misc/archive/ - Historical analysis and session data
- bin/validate-docs.sh - Documentation integrity validation

🎨 **Integration Status**:
- ✅ Boxy UI integration with visual enhancements
- ✅ Sophisticated data cache with hub-aware analysis
- ✅ 18 repository ecosystem tracking
- ✅ Breaking change detection with Rust SemVer compliance

📊 **Current Focus**: Ready for ecosystem integration starting with Meteor

🔄 **Self-Hydrating System**: No manual context reconstruction needed!
